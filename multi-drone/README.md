the code is not finished
it works, but is very messy and unclean  

especially the algorithm to farm the dinosaurs is not good - even though it works

will cleanup and fix everything as soon as i can, but i got a minijob from 8.11 - 11.1, so it has to wait a few days 


(again: everything works. The dino algorithm is inefficient but functional. Ill let my pc run the days im working (the whole system is a closed loop) and complete the game this way. If you want to use it, you can, just dont take code from it for your own game - bc the chance that the code is bad is quite high atm)
